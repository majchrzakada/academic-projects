# academic-projects
This repository contains following projects made as univeristy assignments:

### galacats:
Pygame game inspired by Space Invaders - there are several changes to game dynamics, also instead of spaceships there are cats shooting laser bullets.

### LCG:
Jupyter notebook containing my implementation of Linear Congruential Generator and detailed description of the steps I'm taking throughout the way (in Polish). My tasks in this projects were: 
<ul>
  <li> implementation of pseudo-random integers generator,</li>
  <li> based on created pseudo-random generator: implementation of the random generator, returning real numbers coming from the continuous uniform distribution, including very large numbers (up to 2<sup>64</sup>),</li>
  <li> making the seed of the generator completely random,</li>
  <li> clear, understandable graphic presentation of my results,</li>
  <li> calculating sample mean and variance (comparison to generator already implemented in Python), running Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on generated sample.</li>
